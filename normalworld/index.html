			<p>Normal worlds are worlds that rely on the energy provided by aurabranches to exist. These worlds are located in close proximity to aurabranches, which are powerful sources of aural energy. The energy provided by aurabranches is critical for the existence of life on these worlds, and it is used to power the various natural and technological systems that are present on them. The unique properties of aurabranches make them a key component of the ecosystem of these worlds.</p>

			<h2>Structure</h2>
			<p>The worlds that are sustained by Aurabranches vary greatly in their structure and composition. They can range from vast, open expanses to tight, enclosed spaces. Some worlds possess a single, all-encompassing biome, while others may contain multiple biomes, each with their own unique flora and fauna.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Aurabranches</h2>
			<p>Aurabranches are the structures responsible for sustaining these worlds, utilizing their immense energy and power to hold them together and maintain their stability. Aurabranches are believed to be born due to high concentrations of aetherical energy, becoming a physical structure.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Fauna and Flora</h2>
			<p>The flora and fauna of worlds sustained by Aurabranches can vary greatly. Some worlds may be home to simple, single-celled organisms, while others may possess complex ecosystems filled with diverse species of plants and animals. The presence of an Aurabranch often leads to the emergence of unique and exotic life forms that cannot be found anywhere else in the universe.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Effects of Aurabranches</h2>
			<p>The presence of an Aurabranch has profound effects on the world it sustains. These effects can range from subtle to drastic, depending on the strength and nature of the Aurabranch. For example, some Aurabranches may emit powerful aural energies that imbue the world with unique properties and protection, while others may create powerful gravitational fields that drastically alter the world's landscape.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>In conclusion, the worlds sustained by aurabranches are a unique and intricate part of the greater universe. The existence of these worlds, their inhabitants, and the resources they provide have a profound impact on the surrounding regions. The study of aurabranches and their associated worlds is a field of great interest and importance to researchers and explorers alike. Further exploration and study of these worlds will undoubtedly reveal new insights and opportunities for understanding the nature of the universe.</p>
