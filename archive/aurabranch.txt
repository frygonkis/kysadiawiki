			<h1>Aurabranches</h1>
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jMBP9Pn.png" alt="a anatomical view of an aurabranch." style="max-width: 30%;">
			<p><b>Aurabranches</b> are an important structure in the universe of <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/">Kysadia</a>, appearing as brilliant and intricate patterns of light that connect the <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/normalworld">normal world</a> to the <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/void">void</a>. They are formed by the convergence of <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/aethericenergy">aetheric energy</a> into distinct streams that weave together to create a network of pulsating veins that can span vast distances. The aurabranches are of great importance to the <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/cultures">inhabitants of Kysadia</a>, as they are the primary source of <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/magic">aural energy</a> that powers the world's technology and magic.<br><br>

Despite their importance, little is known about the nature and origin of aurabranches. Some scholars speculate that they are remnants of an ancient event that birthed the universe, while others believe they are the result of the interplay between the void and the <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/normalworld">normal world</a>. Regardless of their origin, the study of aurabranches remains a complex and mysterious field, as the <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/disasters">phenomena</a> are difficult to observe and understand due to their ethereal and ever-changing nature.</p>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Aurabranches are essentially trees of energy that exist within the fabric of space and time in <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/">Kysadia</a>. These nodes are formed by the convergence of various forces and energies, and they are incredibly powerful sources of both <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/aethericenergy">Aetheric</a> and <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/magic">Aural Energy</a>. Aurabranches are often characterized by the presence of intense light, sound, and color, and they can cause strange and powerful <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/disasters">phenomena</a>.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Structure</h2>
			<p>The structure of Aurabranches is complex and poorly understood. At their core, Aurabranches are comprised of a dense concentration of <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/aethericenergy">Ãƒetheric</a> and <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/magic">Aural Energy</a>, which generates the intense light and sound that characterizes them. However, the precise nature of this energy, and how it is structured and organized, is still a matter of much debate and speculation among <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/aurascience">scholars and mystics</a>. It is known that aurabranches have a tree-like structure, having a core and branches coming out of it, both up and down.</p>

			<h2>Function</h2>
			<p>Aurabranches are essential to the functioning of the universe of <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/">Kysadia</a>. They serve as sources of <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/aethericenergy">Aetheric</a> and <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/magic">Aural energy</a>, which are used to power everything from magical spells to advanced technological devices. Additionally, Aurabranches are what contrasts the <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/void">void</a>, making a <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/normalworld">normal world</a> possible on the surface. They are also source of <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/disasters">aura quakes and storms</a> which, due to the high amount of energy concentrated, can mutate living <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/fauna">being</a> and therefore, possibilitate evolution.</p>
