			<p><b>Kysadia</b> is a fictional universe created by a worldbuilder, characterized by the existence of the <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/void">Void</a> and <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/aurabranches">Aurabranches</a>. It is the setting for various stories, games, and other creative works.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Kysadia is a unique universe that features an <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/normalworlds">interconnected networks</a> of worlds that exist within the fabric of the <a href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/void">void</a>, a mysterious and unyielding force that encompasses all of creation. The worlds themselves are formed around <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/aurabranches">aurabranches</a>, powerful structures that serve as a counterbalance to the void, creating a normal world around them.<br><br

Kysadia is home to a diverse array of <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/cultures">cultures</a>, <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/fauna">creatures</a>, and <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/biomes">landscapes</a>, each with their own unique characteristics and histories. The people of Kysadia have developed a deep understanding of the void and the aurabranches that support their existence, using their knowledge to harness the power of <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/auraenergy">Aura Energy</a>, a mysterious and powerful force that permeates throughout the universe.<br><br>

Despite the many wonders and <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/cataclysmicarchive">mysteries</a> of Kysadia, the universe is also home to many <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/disasters">dangers</a> and threats, including <a> href="https://frygonkis.github.io/kysadiawiki/voidincursions">void incursions</a>, cataclysms, and other unknown forces that threaten to unravel the delicate balance between the void and the aurabranches. It is up to the people of Kysadia to navigate these challenges and protect their world from destruction.<br> </p>

			<h2>The Void</h2><!-- ENDED EDITING HERE -->
			<p>The Void is a mysterious and ominous presence in Kysadia. It is characterized by its darkness and emptiness, and its ability to consume anything that gets too close to it. The Void is infinite and has always existed, with no known beginning or end. It is impossible for living beings to survive in the Void, and any attempts to explore it have been futile.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h2>Aurabranches</h2>
			<p>Aurabranches are the structures that contrast the darkness of the Void, creating a normal world around it. A high amount of aetheric energy is what makes an Aurabranch be born, and a small string of aetheric energy connects all the Aurabranches, and therefore different worlds. Aurabranches are essential for the survival of normal worlds, and the collapse of an Aurabranch leads to the consumption of the normal world by the Void.<p>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h2>Factions</h2>
			<p>In the world of Kysadia, there are various factions that inhabit different worlds. These factions have different goals and motivations, often related to the acquisition of power, knowledge, or resources. Some factions seek to harness the power of Aurabranches and aetheric energy, while others seek to protect them from those who would misuse them.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
			<p>Kysadia is home to various locations that are notable for their unique characteristics or historical significance. Some of these locations include: <br>

<li>The Void Mountains: towering peaks that reach into the Void and are home to various creatures and cultures.</li>
<li>The Cataclysmic Archive: a forbidden library that hosts secrets and prophecies that are not meant for people to read.</li>
<li>The Aural Islands: a group of islands that occasionally sink, and whose inhabitants have developed strategies to evacuate to other islands.</li></p>
			</section>
			<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Kysadia is a universe full of mystery and danger, characterized by the ominous presence of the Void and the hope provided by Aurabranches. Its various factions and locations provide endless possibilities for stories and creative works, making it a rich and intriguing setting for exploration.</p>
